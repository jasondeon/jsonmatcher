# MySQL and Python interfacing

Currently this code is designed only to interface with a locally hosted mysql database.
One way of doing this is with tools offered by MySQL, see: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

For the mysql.connector library, see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-connector-python-rf
Or use `pip install mysql-connector-python-rf`

indicators.json is an example of a json file that can be imported as a table in a database.

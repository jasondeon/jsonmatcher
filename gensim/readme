Gensim is a library that implements TF-IDF, LSI and LDA models, cosine similarity, and more.

gensim_example.py
This shows an entire example of text-matching using a small built-in corpus (a bunch of strings). It shows how to parse the corpus and create a dictionary, as well as create a TF-IDF model, create an LSI model, and use cosine similarity to compare a query to the corpus.

gensim_readcorpus.py
Shows how to read and save a dictionary and corpus, using the brown corpus from the nltk library.

gensim_lsi_train.py
Shows how to load a pre-existing dictionary and corpus, train an LSI model, and save it to the disk.

gensim_lsi_test.py
Shows how to load a pre-existing LSI model from the disk.
